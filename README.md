# Rain-Water-Model

#### Access this application at: https://rainwatermodel.pythonanywhere.com/

## Background

This web application was developed as a model to visualize solutions to the [Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/) LeetCode problem. The problem involves determining how much rain water would be trapped between a set of bars of varying heights, which are given as a list of integers. The [Rain Water Model](https://rainwatermodel.pythonanywhere.com/trapping-rain-water/) tab of the web application presents a graph to the user that illustrates how much rain water would be trapped and between what bars the water would be trapped given any input list of integer heights. The user can generate random models or provide a custom set of heights.

## Tools Used

- The algorithm for the [Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/) problem is in Python, and the commented algorithm is provided in the [Python Code](https://rainwatermodel.pythonanywhere.com/code) tab of the web app
- I used the Plotly Python library to build and export the graph that would serve as a visualization of the algorithm
- The web app itself was developed as a Flask Python application
- I used Bootstrap framework components in conjunction with standard HTML and CSS in order to build the frontend
- Deployed the web app to a server using Python Anywhere
